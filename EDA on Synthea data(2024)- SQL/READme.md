## Introduction
As a data scientist, mastering SQL (Structured Query Language) is crucial for efficiently managing, querying, and extracting insights from large datasets. SQL is fundamental in data science for tasks such as data manipulation, data cleaning, and database management, making it an indispensable tool for deriving actionable insights and supporting data-driven decision-making.

This SQL project highlights my proficiency in handling complex data operations, showcasing my ability to write advanced queries, perform data aggregation, and generate meaningful insights. By demonstrating these skills, this project underscores the critical role SQL plays in my toolkit as a data scientist, enabling me to unlock the full potential of data and drive impactful outcomes.

## Data
Data hosted within SyntheticMass has been generated by SyntheaTM, an open-source patient population simulation made available by The MITRE Corporation.
The data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions. It can be used without restriction for a variety of secondary uses in academia, research, industry, and government.
Jason Walonoski, Mark Kramer, Joseph Nichols, Andre Quina, Chris Moesel, Dylan Hall, Carlton Duffett, Kudakwashe Dube, Thomas Gallagher, Scott McLachlan, Synthea: An approach, method, and software mechanism for generating synthetic patients and the synthetic electronic health care record, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, Volume 25, Issue 3, March 2018, Pages 230â€“238, https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocx079 

This data is about 110 patient who are born in between 1938 and 2023.

## Questions explored
1. What is the distribution of patients by gender?
2. What are the top 5 cities from which patients visited the hospital?
3. Who was the most visited patient in 2023, and from which city did they come?
4. How many patients visited the hospital in 2021?
5. Which race has the highest number of Ischemic heart disease (disorder) cases?
6. What are the minimum and maximum incomes of the patients?
7. Which procedures were performed more than 10 times in 2021?
8. What is the total procedural cost by gender?
9. What are the details of payments made in cash for procedures?
10. What allergies do the patients have?
11. Provide information about patients with a care plan for diabetes self-management and an income greater than $50,000.
12. How many conditions does a specific patient have?
13. What are the top 3 administered vaccines in 2021?
14. What is the age distribution of patients who are still alive?
15. What are the top 5 reasons for patient visits?
16. What is the average duration of a consultation by gender?
17. What is the blood pressure status (Hypertensive or Normal) for patients with 'Systolic Blood Pressure' readings?

The possibilities are endless with this data the main aim is to showcase SQL skills.
